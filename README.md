# SPM Auto Splitter
#### vBeta1
An external auto splitter for Dolphin Emulator speedruns of Super Paper Mario.
Supports all versions of the game, and since it's external, will support all timers that use hotkeys.

### How to use
Simply launch Super Paper Mario on Dolphin, and open AutoSplitter.exe
To change your hotkey split to match your LiveSplit, open hotkeys.config and change the key to one of the provided key bindings.
Make sure in your LiveSplit settings or on other timers, to have global hotkeys enabled.
If your key is not on this list and would like it added, please let me know or input a github issue.
